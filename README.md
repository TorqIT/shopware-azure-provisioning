This Docker image can be used to easily provision an Azure environment to host a Shopware solution, leveraging Docker and [Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview).

## Initial provisioning

Follow these steps to provision an environment for the first time:

1. Pull the image and run it with either `docker run` or `docker-compose`. With `compose`, use something like the following:
   ```yaml
   services:
     shopware-azure-provisioning:
        # The image uses semantic versioning
        image: ghcr.io/torqit/shopware-azure-provisioning:1
        volumes:
           # Necessary for running Docker commands within the container
           - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
           # Volume mount in your parameter file as needed - copy this from stub.parameters.json and
           # fill in your preferred values
           - ./azure/parameters.json:/azure/parameters.json:rw
           # You may also want to declare per-environment files like so
           - ./azure/parameters.dev.json:/azure/parameters.dev.json:rw
           - ./azure/parameters.prod.json:/azure/parameters.prod.json:rw
           # Define a volume to hold your login information between container restarts
           - azure:/root/.azure
   volumes:
      azure:
   ```
2. Update `parameters.json` with the appropriate values for your Azure environment. Note that the comments present in `stub.parameters.json` will need to be removed. Note that you will also need to remove the parameters related to custom domains and certificates (see section below) for the initial provisioning.
3. Enter the container shell with `docker exec -it <container-name> bash`.
4. Run `./login-to-tenant.sh parameters.json` and follow the browser prompts to log in. If you wish to use a Service Principal instead of your Microsoft account to perform the provisioning, instead run `az login --service-principal -u <service principal id> -p <service principal password> --tenant <your tenant>`.
5. If a Resource Group has not yet been created (e.g. if you are not an Owner in the Azure tenant), ensure it is created before running any scripts. Ensure also that you have Owner permissions on the created Resource Group.
6. Ensure that `waitForKeyVaultManualIntervention` is set to `true` on initial provisioning.
7. Run `./provision.sh parameters.json` to provision the Azure environment. When the script prompts you to add secrets to the Key Vault, do so in the Azure Portal.
8. On first run of the script, a Service Principal will be created with permissions that will allow it to deploy to your environment via CI/CD workflows. Note down the appId and password returned by this section of the script.

## Custom domains and HTTPS certificates

Container Apps support custom domains and Azure-managed HTTPS certificates, but since they require some manual interaction with your DNS, it is best to configure them manually in your initial provisioning. Use this repository to manage these as follows:

1. For the initial provisioning, leave the `shopwareContainerAppCustomDomains` array blank, like so:
   ```
   "shopwareContainerAppCustomDomains": {
     "value": [
     ]
   },
   ```
2. Once your environment is provisioned, go to https://portal.azure.com and navigate to your Shopware Container App.
3. In the left-hand menu, click "Custom Domains". Click "Add", select the "Managed Certificate" option, and follow the instructions for adding a custom domain to your DNS.
4. Once complete, you should be able to access your Container App at the configured custom domain, and it should be secured with HTTPS.
5. Add the custom domain and certificate to the `shopwareContainerAppCustomDomains` parameter in your `parameters.json` file like so:
   ```
   "shopwareContainerAppCustomDomains": {
      "value": [
         {
            "domainName": "my-domain.example.com"
            "certificateName": "my-certificate"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```
   This will ensure these settings are maintained whenever you deploy infrastructure updates. The certificate name can be found by going to the Container Apps Environment, clicking "Certificates", and copying the value in the "Friendly name" column.

## Automated backups

The provisioning script will automatically configure the following backups:

1. Point-in-time snapshots of the database. Retention of these snapshots is controlled by the `databaseShortTermBackupRetentionDays` parameter.
2. Point-in-time snapshots of the Storage Account (which contains persistent Shopware files such as assets). Retention of these snapshots is controlled by the `storageAccountBackupRetentionDays` parameter.
3. As Azure Database for MySQL does not have built-in support for long-term backups, the scripts will create a Storage Account configured by the `databaseBackupsStorageAccount*` parameters. A custom solution is then required to write backups of the database to this Storage Account.
4. Long-term backups of the Storage Account. The provisioning script will automatically create a Backup Vault that stores monthly backups of the containers. These backups are retained for up to one year.

Note that all backups are stored using Local Redundancy (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#locally-redundant-storage for more information).

## Configuring CI/CD

See https://github.com/TorqIT/shopware-github-actions-workflows for examples of GitHub Actions workflows that can be used to deploy to Container Apps, in particular the `container-apps-*.yml` files.

## Updating an existing environment

Bicep files are declarative, meaning that they declare the desired state of your resources. This means that you can deploy using the same files multiple times, and only the new changes that you've made will be applied. If you wish to change any resource names or properties, simply update them in your `parameters.json` file and re-run `./provision.sh parameters.json`. Keeping the `parameters.json` files committed in your source control is a good practice as it will allow you to maintain a snapshot of your environment's state.

## Useful scripts

Once an environment has been provisioned, the `helper-scripts/` directory contains some useful scripts that can be run against the running environment (see its [README](https://github.com/TorqIT/shopware-azure-provisioning/blob/main/scripts/README.md)).
