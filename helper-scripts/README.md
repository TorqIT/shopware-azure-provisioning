This directory contains some useful scripts that can be run against a running Azure instance. Most of these scripts are designed to work with the parameters.json files, and can usually be invoked with `./<script name>.sh <parameters.json file>`. Prior to running any of these scripts, you must be logged in to the CLI (for simplicity use the `login-to-tenant.sh` script in the parent directory).
